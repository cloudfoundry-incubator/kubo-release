## Developing Kubo

### Upgrading Kubernetes

#### Maintaining offline support
This release can be deployed without external internet access. This is accomplished by loading any required containers into the docker engine of the worker nodes (in [post-start](./jobs/kubelet/templates/bin/post-start.erb)). To maintain this support ensure any updates that depend on new container are added as blobs. See the [download_container_images](./script/download_container_images) script to automate the fetch and add of new images.
